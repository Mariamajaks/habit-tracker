Habit Tracker
A simple, single-page habit tracking application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add daily habits, track their completion over the last seven days, and view their current streak. All data is stored locally in the browser's localStorage.

This project was created as a portfolio piece to practice and demonstrate core front-end web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and accessibility.

✨ Features
Add Habits: Add new habits you want to track.
7-Day View: See your progress for the last seven days at a glance.
Toggle Completion: Click on any day to mark a habit as complete or incomplete.
Streak Counter: Automatically calculates and displays your current streak for each habit.
Local Storage: Your data persists between browser sessions, stored securely on your own device.
Data Management: Export your habit data to a JSON file for backup or import it on another device.
Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
Accessible: Designed with accessibility in mind, including keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Enter) and screen-reader support.
